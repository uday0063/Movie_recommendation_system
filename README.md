Movie Recommendation System

About This Project This is my beginner-level Movie Recommendation System
project. I made it to understand how recommendation systems work and how
machine learning concepts can be used in real applications. The system
suggests movies similar to the one selected by the user.

I built this project mainly for practice and learning purposes, so the
code may not be perfect, but it helped me understand data handling,
similarity calculations, and basic web app deployment.

How It Works 1. User selects a movie from a dropdown. 2. The system
finds similar movies using a similarity matrix. 3. It shows the top 5
recommended movies. 4. Posters are fetched using an online movie API.

Technologies Used - Python - Pandas - Pickle - Streamlit - Requests API

Project Files - application_app.py → main Streamlit app file -
movie_recommendation.ipynb → notebook where model was built -
movies_dict.pkl → movie dataset - similarity.pkl → similarity matrix

How to Run 1. Install dependencies: pip install streamlit pandas
requests

2.  Run the app: streamlit run application_app.py

Features - Simple UI - Fast recommendations - Movie posters included -
Beginner-friendly code structure

What I Learned - How recommendation systems work - Handling datasets -
Using APIs - Building simple web apps - Converting models into usable
applications

Future Improvements - Add more movies - Improve recommendation
accuracy - Add filters (genre, rating, year) - Better UI design
